### Odysee Livestream Viewers

This is a small script you can use on localhost from any folder to display the number of viewers of your livestream in Odysee. You can import this script into your **OBS or Streamlabs** as a browser source.

To use it is pretty simple. In the script.js file you need to change the "xxx" and put the ClaimID of your Odysee channel, then you need to save the changes, upload the file to OBS and go live with your channel. That's it.

As viewers watch your livestream the counter will display the number in real time.

This is a pretty basic script that can be improved in many ways. I hope it helps.
